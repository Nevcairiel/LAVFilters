 * @GNUTLS_NONBLOCK: Connection should not block. Since 3.0.0.
 * @GNUTLS_NO_SIGNAL: In systems where SIGPIPE is delivered on send, it will be disabled. That flag has effect in systems which support the MSG_NOSIGNAL sockets flag (since 3.4.2).
 * @GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS: Do not enable any TLS extensions by default (since 3.1.2). As TLS 1.2 and later require extensions this option is considered obsolete and should not be used.
 * @GNUTLS_NO_REPLAY_PROTECTION: Disable any replay protection in DTLS. This must only be used if  replay protection is achieved using other means. Since 3.2.2.
 * @GNUTLS_ALLOW_ID_CHANGE: Allow the peer to replace its certificate, or change its ID during a rehandshake. This change is often used in attacks and thus prohibited by default. Since 3.5.0.
 * @GNUTLS_ENABLE_FALSE_START: Enable the TLS false start on client side if the negotiated ciphersuites allow it. This will enable sending data prior to the handshake being complete, and may introduce a risk of crypto failure when combined with certain key exchanged; for that GnuTLS may not enable that option in ciphersuites that are known to be not safe for false start. Since 3.5.0.
 * @GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_START: Under TLS1.3 allow the server to return earlier than the full handshake
 *   finish; similarly to false start the handshake will be completed once data are received by the
 *   client, while the server is able to transmit sooner. This is not enabled by default as it could
 *   break certain existing server assumptions and use-cases. Since 3.6.4.
 * @GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_DATA: Under TLS1.3 allow the server to receive early data sent as part of the initial ClientHello (0-RTT). This is not enabled by default as early data has weaker security properties than other data. Since 3.6.5.
 * @GNUTLS_FORCE_CLIENT_CERT: When in client side and only a single cert is specified, send that certificate irrespective of the issuers expected by the server. Since 3.5.0.
 * @GNUTLS_NO_TICKETS: Flag to indicate that the session should not use resumption with session tickets.
 * @GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP3: Generate key shares for the top-3 different groups which are enabled.
 *   That is, as each group is associated with a key type (EC, finite field, x25519), generate
 *   three keys using %GNUTLS_PK_DH, %GNUTLS_PK_EC, %GNUTLS_PK_ECDH_X25519 if all of them are enabled.
 * @GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP2: Generate key shares for the top-2 different groups which are enabled.
 *   For example (ECDH + x25519). This is the default.
 * @GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP: Generate key share for the first group which is enabled.
 *   For example x25519. This option is the most performant for client (less CPU spent
 *   generating keys), but if the server doesn't support the advertized option it may
 *   result to more roundtrips needed to discover the server's choice.
 * @GNUTLS_NO_AUTO_REKEY: Disable auto-rekeying under TLS1.3. If this option is not specified
 *   gnutls will force a rekey after 2^24 records have been sent.
 * @GNUTLS_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH: Enable post handshake authentication for server and client. When set and
 *   a server requests authentication after handshake %GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST will be returned
 *   by gnutls_record_recv(). A client should then call gnutls_reauth() to re-authenticate.
 * @GNUTLS_SAFE_PADDING_CHECK: Flag to indicate that the TLS 1.3 padding check will be done in a
 *   safe way which doesn't leak the pad size based on GnuTLS processing time. This is of use to
 *   applications which hide the length of transferred data via the TLS1.3 padding mechanism and

 *    requests to. That is, reauthentication is handled within gnutls_record_recv(), and
 *    the %GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE or %GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST are not returned. This must be

 *    interrupted calls to gnutls_record_recv() based on the output of gnutls_record_get_direction(),
 *    since gnutls_record_recv() could be interrupted when sending when this flag is enabled.
 *    Note this flag may not be used if you are using the same session for sending and receiving
 *    in different threads.
 * @GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_DATA: Under TLS1.3 allow the server to receive early data sent as part of the initial ClientHello (0-RTT). 
 *    This is not enabled by default as early data has weaker security properties than other data. Since 3.6.5.
 * @GNUTLS_ENABLE_RAWPK: Allows raw public-keys to be negotiated during the handshake. Since 3.6.6.

 *                      application is aware of the followed security policy, and needs
 *                      to utilize disallowed operations for other reasons (e.g., compatibility).
 * @GNUTLS_FIPS140_LOG: Similarly to %GNUTLS_FIPS140_LAX, it allows forbidden operations; any use of them results
 *                      to a message to the audit callback functions.
 * @GNUTLS_FIPS140_SELFTESTS: A transient state during library initialization. That state
