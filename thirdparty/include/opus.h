 * @mainpage Opus
 *
 * The Opus codec is designed for interactive speech and audio transmission over the Internet.
 * It is designed by the IETF Codec Working Group and incorporates technology from
 * Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.
 *
 * The Opus codec is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications,
 * including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live music
 * performances. It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high quality
 * stereo music. Its main features are:

 * @li Sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz
 * @li Bit-rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s
 * @li Support for both constant bit-rate (CBR) and variable bit-rate (VBR)
 * @li Audio bandwidth from narrowband to full-band
 * @li Support for speech and music
 * @li Support for mono and stereo
 * @li Support for multichannel (up to 255 channels)
 * @li Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms
 * @li Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC)
 * @li Floating point and fixed-point implementation
 *
 * Documentation sections:

/** @defgroup opus_encoder Opus Encoder
  * @{
  *
  * @brief This page describes the process and functions used to encode Opus.
  *
  * Since Opus is a stateful codec, the encoding process starts with creating an encoder
  * state. This can be done with:
  *
  * @code
  * int          error;
  * OpusEncoder *enc;
  * enc = opus_encoder_create(Fs, channels, application, &error);
  * @endcode
  *
  * From this point, @c enc can be used for encoding an audio stream. An encoder state
  * @b must @b not be used for more than one stream at the same time. Similarly, the encoder
  * state @b must @b not be re-initialized for each frame.
  *
  * While opus_encoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
  * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
  *
  * @code
  * int          size;
  * int          error;
  * OpusEncoder *enc;
  * size = opus_encoder_get_size(channels);
  * enc = malloc(size);
  * error = opus_encoder_init(enc, Fs, channels, application);
  * @endcode
  *
  * where opus_encoder_get_size() returns the required size for the encoder state. Note that
  * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assuptions should be made about it.
  *
  * The encoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
  * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
  *
  * It is possible to change some of the encoder's settings using the opus_encoder_ctl()
  * interface. All these settings already default to the recommended value, so they should
  * only be changed when necessary. The most common settings one may want to change are:
  *
  * @code
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_BITRATE(bitrate));
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_COMPLEXITY(complexity));
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_SIGNAL(signal_type));
  * @endcode
  *
  * where
  *
  * @arg bitrate is in bits per second (b/s)
  * @arg complexity is a value from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest complexity and 10 is the highest
  * @arg signal_type is either OPUS_AUTO (default), OPUS_SIGNAL_VOICE, or OPUS_SIGNAL_MUSIC
  *
  * See @ref opus_encoderctls and @ref opus_genericctls for a complete list of parameters that can be set or queried. Most parameters can be set or changed at any time during a stream.
  *
  * To encode a frame, opus_encode() or opus_encode_float() must be called with exactly one frame (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 ms) of audio data:
  * @code
  * len = opus_encode(enc, audio_frame, frame_size, packet, max_packet);
  * @endcode
  *
  * where
  * <ul>
  * <li>audio_frame is the audio data in opus_int16 (or float for opus_encode_float())</li>
  * <li>frame_size is the duration of the frame in samples (per channel)</li>
  * <li>packet is the byte array to which the compressed data is written</li>
  * <li>max_packet is the maximum number of bytes that can be written in the packet (4000 bytes is recommended)</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * opus_encode() and opus_encode_frame() return the number of bytes actually written to the packet.
  * The return value <b>can be negative</b>, which indicates that an error has occurred. If the return value
  * is 1 byte, then the packet does not need to be transmitted (DTX).
  *
  * Once the encoder state if no longer needed, it can be destroyed with
  *
  * @code
  * opus_encoder_destroy(enc);
  * @endcode
  *
  * If the encoder was created with opus_encoder_init() rather than opus_encoder_create(),
  * then no action is required aside from potentially freeing the memory that was manually
  * allocated for it (calling free(enc) for the example above)
  *

  *
  * The decoding process also starts with creating a decoder
  * state. This can be done with:

  * int          error;
  * OpusDecoder *dec;
  * dec = opus_decoder_create(Fs, channels, &error);
  * @endcode
  * where
  * @li Fs is the sampling rate and must be 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, or 48000
  * @li channels is the number of channels (1 or 2)
  * @li error will hold the error code in case or failure (or OPUS_OK on success)
  * @li the return value is a newly created decoder state to be used for decoding
  *
  * While opus_decoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
  * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
  * @code
  * int          size;
  * int          error;
  * OpusDecoder *dec;
  * size = opus_decoder_get_size(channels);
  * dec = malloc(size);
  * error = opus_decoder_init(dec, Fs, channels);
  * @endcode
  * where opus_decoder_get_size() returns the required size for the decoder state. Note that
  * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assuptions should be made about it.
  *
  * The decoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
  * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
  *
  * To decode a frame, opus_decode() or opus_decode_float() must be called with a packet of compressed audio data:
  * @code
  * frame_size = opus_decode(dec, packet, len, decoded, max_size, 0);
  * @endcode
  * where
  *
  * @li packet is the byte array containing the compressed data
  * @li len is the exact number of bytes contained in the packet
  * @li decoded is the decoded audio data in opus_int16 (or float for opus_decode_float())
  * @li max_size is the max duration of the frame in samples (per channel) that can fit into the decoded_frame array
  *
  * opus_decode() and opus_decode_float() return the number of samples (per channel) decoded from the packet.
  * If that value is negative, then an error has occured. This can occur if the packet is corrupted or if the audio
  * buffer is too small to hold the decoded audio.
  *
  * Opus is a stateful codec with overlapping blocks and as a result Opus
  * packets are not coded independently of each other. Packets must be
  * passed into the decoder serially and in the correct order for a correct
  * decode. Lost packets can be replaced with loss concealment by calling
  * the decoder with a null pointer and zero length for the missing packet.
  *
  * A single codec state may only be accessed from a single thread at
  * a time and any required locking must be performed by the caller. Separate
  * streams must be decoded with separate decoder states and can be decoded
  * in parallel unless the library was compiled with NONTHREADSAFE_PSEUDOSTACK
  * defined.
